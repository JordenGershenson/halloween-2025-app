    - code_location: gives it to you, not hidden
    - literal: Allen or Tim will be dressed as the quartermater and show guests how to log on and use the site. 
    - flavor: 
    (At first doesn't realize you are a human, then introduces you to the basic plot and pleads with you to help protext the fragments from the trading company. Gives you his fragment and points you to the marin.)
2: Marine
    - code_location: on bottle
    - literal: We have a large inflatable skeleton pirate drinking from a bottle on the front lawn. 
    - flavor: Drunken marine who is rowdy and was always getting in trouble.

3: Master at arms
    - code_location: back of his head
    - literal: Skeleton that is inside the beer chest cooler (looks like an old footlocker) that we have setup with a pump such that he is 'drinking' from a bottle of rum. This is in the main living room which is the 'main deck' of the ship
    - flavor: The master at arms was like a military first shirt and always had to deal with the rowdy crew members, especially marines, and tightly control the flow of alcohol such that they stayed in line. Once he died, he realized he was free to drink as much as he wanted and hid himself and the fragment in the drink locker 
    clue_to_the_next_fragment: (Master at arms had a deal with the cook to get extra rations and knows he hid a fragment somewhere in the kitchen)
4: Cook
    - code_location: on Knife Stand
    - literal: no skeleton or anything, just flavor text when you find the code and the ghost of the cook talks to you
    - flavor: The cook is a tough cracking older woman who was adept at dealing with the unsavory pirates. She prided herself on stretching out rations and keeping her boys fed to fight. She's the mother of the surgeon.
    clue_to_the_next_fragment: (Borrowed a knife from the surgeon, though he might have hidden it in one of those books he's always reading)
5: Surgeon
    - code_location: A highlighted word on page 492 of a book called Anatomy in Surgey by Philip Thorek. The highlighted word (and code) is AMOS. This is in the Abdomen chapter under Liver.
    - literal: We do literally have this book and it will be hidden on a bookshelf in the entry way "Cargo Hold/Surgery Theater" behind the quarter master's desk/surgery table. 
    - flavor: The surgeon is a character somewhat similar to the doctor from Master and Commander. Was previously a Royal Navy doctor but joined the crew when his vessel was attacked by pirates. He continued to operate on his patient even though the pirates had taken the ship. The captain appreciated his 'stones' and recruited him. He is learned and a bit snooty for some of the crew, but he has their respect as the most skilled doctor on the seas, even if he is a bit of a dandy.
    clue_to_the_next_fragment: (Helped drain an abcess from the gunner)
6: Master Gunner
    - code_location: on the cannon sled on the front porch
    - literal: The front porch has 2 prop cannons we made, they have wooden sleds/carriages and the code is hidden on the one to the right
    - flavor: Thinking this character will be sort of similar in tone to Sergeant Johnson from Halo. 
    clue_to_the_next_fragment: (Saw the navigator with one, map down the stairwell)
7: Navigator
    - code_location: on the map frame
    - literal: There is a large map of the world hung on the wall in the landing of the stairs heading down to the basement (lower deck)

    - flavor: Younger kid who is rough around the edges
    clue_to_the_next_fragment: (Purser, giving share, saw he had purser)
9: Purser
    - code_location: underside of treasure box lid
    - literal: We have a large finished basement that hes been decorated to look like the lower decks of a wrecked ship. There are jellyfish, coral, large cracks and cannon holes in the 'hull' (we've put up plastic wallpaper everywhere that looks like ship hull). We have decorated the shower in the basement bathroom to look like the treasure room/store. There is a large chest filled with gold.
    - flavor: Similar in tone and style to a warcraft goblin. Money hoarding and new york style manner of speaking. Maybe an American who has new world attitudes about money and pirating.
    clue_to_the_next_fragment:(Leads to captain at the wheel)
10: Captain
    - code_location: in the spoke of the wheel
    - literal: On the table in the living room we have a large wheel/helm. The outer spokes of the wheel can be unscrewed, the code is hidden on the underside of one of these spokes.
    - flavor: The captain was once a learned man. He is close friends with the doctor now as they share a love of books and enlightenment ideas. The captain is very different in mannerism to his crew but he has their undying respect as he is always willing to fight for them and never asks them to do anything he wouldn't do himself. He is supremely concerned about the moral consquences of the Crimson Charter and he wants the freedom of all men. Every company should be run democratically and openly like he runs his ship. He tried to impress upon you the importance of your task and the true reasons for it.
    clue_to_the_next_fragment: (First mate had a lockbox with the final fragment)
11: The First Mate
    - code_location: locked in lockebox
    - literal: We have a small green metal lockbox that will be hidden in the oven. 
    - flavor: Trust your judgement to flavor him as you see fit. Once you collect the final fragment the question is what to do with it. The next stage of the evenening has to do with collecting the 5 items that will make you the pirate king, embuing you with the power to fight off the company men when they arrive.
    clue_to_the_next_fragment: N/A
