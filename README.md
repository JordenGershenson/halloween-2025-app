Then open your browser to: `http://localhost:8000`

### Option 2: Node.js

cd F:\halloween-2025-app

# Start the server
http-server -p 8000
```

Then open: `http://localhost:8000`

### Option 3: PHP

If you have PHP installed:

## File Structure

```

## Customizing Your Hunt

### Editing Clues and Codes

Open `config.json` and customize:

1. **Change Codes**: Replace the codes like "1234", "5678", etc. with your own 4-digit codes
2. **Edit Content**: Update the `title`, `story`, and `hint` for each clue
3. **Add/Remove Clues**: Add more clue entries or remove some
4. **Update Total**: Make sure `totalClues` matches the number of clues you have

Example structure:

```json
{
  "totalClues": 5,
  "clues": {
    "1234": {
      "title": "Your Clue Title",
      "story": "The story/lore text that appears when they find this clue...",
      "hint": "A hint about where to find the NEXT clue..."
    }
  }
}
```

### Example Clue Placement Ideas

The default config assumes these hiding spots:
- **Code 1234**: Captain's Quarters ‚Üí Hidden in a bedroom
- **Code 5678**: Galley ‚Üí Hidden in/near the kitchen (fridge mentioned)
- **Code 9012**: Crew's Quarters ‚Üí Hidden in another bedroom
- **Code 3456**: Crow's Nest ‚Üí Hidden somewhere high up
- **Code 7890**: Cargo Hold ‚Üí Hidden in a basement, closet, or storage area

### Printing Physical Clues

Create small cards or notes with:
1. Some thematic decoration
2. The 4-digit code prominently displayed
3. Optional: Additional riddle or flavor text

You can design these in any graphics program, or simply write them on aged-looking paper.

## Sharing with Guests

### On Local Network

1. Find your computer's local IP address:
   - Windows: `ipconfig` (look for IPv4 Address)
   - Mac/Linux: `ifconfig` or `ip addr`

2. Start the server on your computer

3. Share the URL with guests: `http://YOUR-IP-ADDRESS:8000`
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.100:8000`

4. Guests can access it on their phones by entering this URL in their browser

### Tips for Party Setup

- **Test First**: Run through the entire hunt yourself before the party
- **WiFi**: Make sure your WiFi is working well
- **Battery**: Remind guests to have charged phones
- **Backup**: Have printed clues as a backup if tech fails
- **Groups**: Consider having guests work in teams
- **Prizes**: Maybe hide an actual physical treasure at the final location!

## Customization Ideas

### Changing the Theme

Edit `styles.css` to modify:
- Colors (the `:root` section has all color variables)
- Fonts
- Background effects
- Animations

### Adding Sound Effects

You could add pirate music or sound effects by adding audio elements:

```javascript
// Add to app.js
const successSound = new Audio('success.mp3');
successSound.play();
```

### Adding Images

Add images to clue pages by modifying the clue content in `config.json`:

```json
"story": "<img src='clue-image.jpg' style='max-width:100%'><p>Your story text...</p>"
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot GET /clue.html" or similar errors

Make sure you're running a local server (see Quick Start options above). Opening the HTML files directly (file://) won't work because the app uses JavaScript fetch() which requires HTTP.

### Progress not saving

Make sure your browser allows localStorage. Check browser console (F12) for errors.

### Clues not appearing

1. Check that `config.json` is valid JSON (use a JSON validator online)
2. Check browser console (F12) for errors
3. Make sure codes in config.json are strings ("1234" not 1234)

### Mobile devices can't connect

1. Verify your phone is on the same WiFi network as the server
2. Check firewall settings aren't blocking connections
3. Try temporarily disabling firewall to test

## Advanced: Adding More Features

### Leaderboard

You could add a leaderboard by saving completion times and displaying them:
- Use localStorage or a simple backend
- Show fastest times on completion page

### Hints System

Add a "hint" button that reveals progressive hints:
- Show hint 1 after 5 minutes
- Show hint 2 after 10 minutes

### Team Mode

Track multiple teams separately:
- Add team selection at start
- Store progress per team
- Show comparative progress

## Admin Panel

The admin panel allows the Game Master to manage the party in real-time.

### Accessing Admin Panel

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/admin.html`
2. Default password: `captain` (change in admin.js:10)
3. Access the Game Master Control Panel
