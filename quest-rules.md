There are three phases to a combat round: Pre-Combat, Flip, and Post-Combat.

- Flip (Main Combat)
  - Players choose any one "Shot Card" (Common and Uncommon Cards, valued 2-Ace) and may also choose up to one accompanying "On-Flip" rare card. 
  - Both players play these cards face down, and then at the same time, flip up the cards.
  - The player who plays the Shot Card with the highest value wins this combat.
  - The loser of the combat pays **5 doubloons** to the winner after On-Flip effects have been resolved and when the winner of the combat has been decided.
  - Ties go to the defender of the combat.
- Post-Combat
  - Players may play any one rare card that is marked "Post-Combat" from their hand.
- Combat Resolution
  - All cards played during the combat round are exchanged between the two players. This includes Rare Cards.
    - Ex: Player A plays 1 Pre-Combat Card, 1 Shot Card and 1 Post-Combat Card. Player B plays 1 Shot Card. At the end of the combat, Player A recieves Player B's 1 Shot Card; Player B recieves Player A's Pre-Combat Card, Shot Card, and Post-Combat card.
