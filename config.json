Wait... wait... *squints suspiciously* Ye be not Company dogs, are ye? No... no, I see it in yer eyes. Ye've the look of free folk about ye!\n\nListen close, for time be short! I be the Quartermaster of Captain Elias 'Blackheart' Rourke, finest pirate to ever sail these cursed waters! Fifty years ago, on this very night, we staged a mutiny against those devils at the East Mercantile Company. We'd discovered their foulest secret - The Crimson Charter - a contract written in blood and black magic!\n\nEvery poor soul who signed the Company's Articles of Employment unknowingly bound their very spirit to that infernal document. The Charter gave them supernatural control over any man who took their coin. Free sailors became naught but puppets, their will enslaved to Company greed!\n\nThe Captain, brave soul that he was, stole the Charter right from Admiral Grimm's own cabin! We tried to destroy it - threw it in fire, tried to tear it, even had the ship's surgeon take his finest blade to it. Nothing worked! That's when we found her - Madame Corbeau, a sea witch of terrible power. She helped us devise a ritual, see? Shattered the Charter into eleven fragments, each hidden with a protective curse!\n\nBut tonight... *voice drops to urgent whisper* Tonight the boundaries between worlds grow thin! Admiral Thaddeus Grimm himself has found our wrecked ship. His agents search even now for the fragments, but his full force is en-route! If he recovers them all and reforms the Charter, every soul who sails the seven seas will be enslaved forever!\n\nWe dead cannot touch the fragments ourselves - the curse prevents it. But you... you living souls can gather them! Help us keep the seas free! Take this first fragment - guard it well! The Marine's got another piece. That drunk fool's probably still clutching his bottle somewhere on deck. Find him and the others before Grimm's dogs do! The fate of all free sailors rests in your hands now!\"",
