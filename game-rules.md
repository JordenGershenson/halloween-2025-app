# Pirate's Treasure Hunt Rules

## Objective

## How to Play

### 1. Finding Clues
- Look around for physical clues hidden throughout the location
- Each clue has a **4-character code** written on it
- Codes can contain letters and numbers (e.g., "AB12", "X7Y9")
- Some quests require an extra passphrase to complete!

### 2. Entering Codes
- Enter each code you find into the app on the main page
- Codes are **not** case-sensitive
- If you enter the wrong code, you'll get a pirate-themed error message

### 3. Progressive Hints
- Each clue has multiple hints that unlock over time
- The first hint is usually available immediately
- Additional hints unlock after waiting a certain amount of time
- Use hints wisely to help you find the next clue!

### 4. Tracking Progress
- Your progress is automatically saved as you find clues
- You can revisit any clue you've already discovered
- The progress bar shows how many clues you've found

### 5. Completing the Quest

- Check the leaderboard to see how you rank against other pirates!

## Tips
- **Take your time** - the hints will help if you get stuck
